# Designing a Webpage for a Hamburger restaurant in React

A webpage I created to practice web design with react. I used CSS Modules for the different parts of the website. I also used the packages react-slick for the carousal, simple-react-lightbox and react-parallax.

## Modules used

- React 17.0.2
- react-parallax 3.2.1
- react-slick 0.28.1
- simple-react-lightbox 3.6.6
